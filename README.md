# The Harmonic Sytem

The Harmonic System is a new way to think about music theory. It makes analyzing, transcribing and understanding harmony easier. Its simple to use and can be seen as a replacement for Roman Numeral Analysis.

<!-- Although its not required to know a lot about music theory to use the Harmonic System, this blog aims to explain the system for people who have a basic understanding of music theory.  -->

### How does it work?
The whole idea begind the Harmonic System is to use numbers as the names for the notes, instead of the traditional letters (C, C#, D, D#...) or syllables (do, re, mi, ...)
