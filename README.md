# The Harmonic Sytem

The Harmonic System is a new way to think about music theory. It makes analyzing, transcribing and understanding harmony easier. Its simple to use and can be seen as a replacement for Roman Numeral Analysis.

Although its not required to know a lot about music theory to use the Harmonic System, this blog aims to explain the system for people who already have a basic understanding of music theory. 

### How does it work?
The idea is to use numbers as names for the notes, instead of the traditional letters (C, C#, D, D#...) or syllables (do, re, mi, ...). Each note is assigned a number from $0$ to $11$ in the following way:

Note that the notes are not labeled in order. Instead two notes which are $7$ semitones (one fifth) apart, always have labels differing by $1$, starting at $Ab = 0$. For example, $C$ and $G$ are a fifth apart, and their labels are $4$ and $5$.
